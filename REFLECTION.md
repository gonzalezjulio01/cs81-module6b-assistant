# Reflection – Personal Assistant Project

## What made your assistant “personal” to you?

I made it personal by adding real tasks from my actual week, like finishing this assignment and replying to messages. I also gave it a name that felt kind of techy but friendly (Nova), which made it feel like a real little assistant I’d use. The mood part also made it feel more human.

## What challenges did you face using this?

The main thing that confused me was how to use `this` inside the methods. At first, I wasn’t sure how it knew which assistant object it was referring to, but after testing a few things, it started to click. Making sure the mood updated after doing a task also took a bit of trial and error.

## Which method would you improve or expand?

I would probably add a feature to see all the tasks left in a nicer way, like listing them with numbers or adding due times. I’d also maybe add a way to set the assistant’s mood based on how many tasks are done, like feeling “stressed” if nothing’s been finished yet.
